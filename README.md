# Reinforcement-Learning-Snake-from-scratch

Reinforcement Learning (RL) looks fun so I am developing a basic project to get a hang of what is what. Topics to cover:
- Custom RL environemnts in OpenAI Gym <- current stage (creating snake game that an AI can play)
- RL agents implemented from scratch
- Model performance comparison (greedy, e-greedy, Q-learning, expected SARSA and more)
