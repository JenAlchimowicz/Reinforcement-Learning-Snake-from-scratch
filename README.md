# Reinforcement-Learning-Snake-from-scratch

Project developed for fun to get a basic understanding of reinforcement learning. Topics covered:
- Custom RL environemnt for snake game based on OpenAI Gym
- RL agents implemented from scratch
- Model performance comparison (greedy, e-greedy, Q-learning, expected SARSA and more) <- current stage

Current main challange:
- Achieve good performance on one model <- looking for parameters of the env and a Q-learning agent that would give good results

Example of current performance:
